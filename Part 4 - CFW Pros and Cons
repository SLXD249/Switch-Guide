Part 4: CFW Pros and Cons<br/>
Atmosphere<br/>
Pro: Has the fusee payload for instant launching<br/>
Pro: Contains "Creport", which is a background process that prevents your switch from sending crash reports to Nintendo, which greatly reduces your chances of being banned.<br/>
<br/>
Con: Fusee is a barebones payload launcher and doesn't have hekate features.<br/>
Con: Doesn't support NSP/XCI game loading. Must install game with alternative CFW and apply sigpatches to run on Atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
ReiNX<br/>
Pro: Simple to use just inject the payload and put the files on your sd and your done<br/>
Pro: Has sigpatches for homebrew nsps/unsinged titles<br/>
<br/>
Con: Randomly sends crash reports to Nintendo when you are connected to the Internet, regardless of if you're using a DNS blocker, which greatly increases your chances of being banned the longer you're connected.<br/>
Con: quite Buggy and crashes alot and that means crash repots<br/>
<br/>

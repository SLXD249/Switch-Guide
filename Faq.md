<b> Is it safe to use homebrew or will I get banned?<br/>


The Switch comes with a lot of telemetry. As long as the Switch is connected to the internet, Nintendo gets a report about a lot of different actions and states and has the option to log or act on them. Even if the Switch is offline and connects to the internet at a later point, Nintendo still recieves information about what happened while the Switch was disconnected.

To disable some of this telemetry it is adviced to disable the sending of error reports in the System Settings of the Switch. Additionally if you live in the EU you can set the "do not share" option on https://accounts.nintendo.com/setting to prevent your Switch from sending a lot of telemetry.

Nintendo still recieves a lot of information, even with those options disabled. We also cannot know if Nintendo decides to look for something in the logs and ban people in retrospect. They have also shown to expand their telemetry options with every other firmware update.

Currently all bans have been for very obvious and intrusive actions, specifically:

    Developers using their unique Switch data to poke and reverse-engineer Nintendos Server responses
    People pirating games and using them online
    People changing their profile pictures to custom pictures (which is not possible without pirating the Nintendo SDK)
    People using savegame editors to unlock content that is not available yet and using it online (Splatoon 2)
    People cheating online in general (Modifying Cart stats in MK8)


This however does not mean that Nintendo won't decide to ban people for harmless homebrew in the future. If you are scared to get banned then don't use homebrew for now. Once Atmosphere CFW releases we will be able to create a dual-boot (emunand) solution, that allows us to have a clean, online firmware and a seperate offline firmware for homebrew related things. Unbanning on the Switch will be a lot harder, if not impossible.<br/>

What is a "jig"?
A jig is a small piece of metal that is used to bridge the gaps between two of the "pins" in the right Joy-Con port in order to hard-wire RCM Mode. These items usually differ from a modified paper clip or a piece of aluminum foil or a custom-made 3d-printed item that fits in the port to trip the pins. However, one must be very careful what pins you trip, because not only are they very small and difficult to see, but if you trip "pin number 7", you will automatically brick your switch. Therefore, it is highly recommended that you buy a prefabricated one from eBay for the average price of $3-$7
